## Project Overview
Meteorite-Fireball-Tracker Mapping App is a web application designed to map and track real-time fireball (bright meteor) reports. The goal is to highlight which events have resulted in meteorite recoveries and guide users to search areas for both recent and historical meteorite falls. The project also displays locations of known meteorite falls and finds, as well as AMS Fireball event numbers and links.

## Features
- Real-time mapping of new fireball events  
- Database and visualization of previous meteorite falls and finds  
- Strewn field overlays to estimate search areas  
- Integration with external fireball reporting sources (e.g., AMS)  
- Easy-to-use interactive map interface

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- JavaScript  
- Data and libraries imported via GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Internet connection for live data

### Installation
